In C++ the number of digits a long long int can have is a maximum of 20. And the question is to store the 22 digit number which is not easy to store in any kind of primitive type. So to deal with this type of problem , design a new data type which is going to be called BigInt.

 A few basic operations are being implemented on the new data type.

1) Add two big integers.
2) Subtract two big integers.
3) Multiply two big integers.
4) Divide two big integers.
5) Modulo two big integers.
6) Raise a big integer to a power.
7) The square root of a big integer.
8) Comparison between two big integers to check which is greater and which is smaller.
9) Find the number of digits in the big integer.
10) Print the big integer.
11) Convert an integer to a big integer.

Applications Of BigInt:

->Calculating the Fibonacci number of a large number.

->Calculating the Catalan number of a large number.

->Calculating the Factorial of a big integer.
